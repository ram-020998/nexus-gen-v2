# NexusGen Document Intelligence Hub - Complete Development Summary

## Project Overview
This document contains the complete development journey of NexusGen (formerly DocFlow), a comprehensive Document Intelligence Hub built from scratch. The project evolved from a simple spec breakdown generator to a multi-functional RAG-integrated application with flexible data source architecture.

## Final Application Architecture

### Core Features
1. **Spec Document Breakdown** - Upload documents and generate structured breakdowns with GIVEN/WHEN/THEN acceptance criteria
2. **Design Document Verification** - Paste design content and get AI-powered gap analysis
3. **Design Document Creation** - Generate comprehensive design documents from acceptance criteria
4. **AI Chat Assistant** - Real-time chat with document knowledge base

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.8+, Flask 2.3+, SQLAlchemy with SQLite
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5, Vanilla JavaScript, Dark theme UI
- **AI Integration**: Amazon Q CLI Agents (4 specialized agents)
- **Data Sources**: Flexible architecture supporting Mock, Bedrock, and External RAG
- **File Processing**: Support for TXT, MD, DOCX, PDF formats
- **Export**: Professional Excel generation with multiple sheets

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Main requests table (breakdown, verify, create)
requests (
    id, action_type, filename, input_text, status,
    rag_query, rag_response, final_output,
    created_at, updated_at, export_path
)

-- Chat sessions (separate tracking)
chat_sessions (
    id, session_id, question, rag_response, answer, created_at
)
```

### Flexible Data Source Architecture
The application supports three data sources via configuration:
- **MOCK**: Default mock responses for development/testing
- **BEDROCK**: Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base integration
- **RAG**: External RAG API integration

Configuration via environment variables:
```bash
export DATA_SOURCE=MOCK|BEDROCK|RAG
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export BEDROCK_KB_ID=WAQ6NJLGKN
export RAG_API_URL=http://your-rag-api:8080/api/query
```
