# NexusGen Refactoring Guide

## Phase 1: Core Architecture Improvements ✅

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Abstract Base Classes and Interfaces
- **`core/interfaces.py`**: Created foundational abstractions
  - `RAGServiceInterface`: Interface for RAG services
  - `ProcessorInterface`: Interface for Q agent processors  
  - `RepositoryInterface`: Interface for data repositories
  - `BaseService`: Base class with common functionality

#### 2. Custom Exception Hierarchy
- **`core/exceptions.py`**: Structured exception handling
  - `NexusGenException`: Base application exception
  - `ServiceException`: Service layer exceptions
  - `ValidationException`: Input validation exceptions
  - `ProcessingException`: Processing-specific exceptions

#### 3. Dependency Injection Container
- **`core/container.py`**: Simple DI container implementation
  - Singleton and transient service registration
  - Constructor injection support
  - Service resolution with error handling

#### 4. Repository Pattern
- **`repositories/request_repository.py`**: Data access abstraction for requests
- **`repositories/chat_repository.py`**: Data access abstraction for chat sessions
- Clean separation of data access from business logic

#### 5. Specialized Processors
- **`services/processors/base_processor.py`**: Base Q agent processor
- **`services/processors/breakdown_processor.py`**: Specialized breakdown processing
- **`services/processors/verification_processor.py`**: Specialized verification processing
- **`services/processors/creation_processor.py`**: Specialized creation processing

#### 6. Refactored Services
- **`services/refactored_bedrock_service.py`**: Clean Bedrock service with proper abstractions
- **`services/refactored_request_service.py`**: Request service with dependency injection

#### 7. Enhanced Models
- **`models/enhanced_models.py`**: Rich domain models with business logic
  - Validation methods
  - Computed properties
  - Status management
  - Confidence scoring

#### 8. Service Registry
- **`core/service_registry.py`**: Centralized service configuration
- **Updated `app.py`**: Integration with DI container and error handling

### Key Improvements Achieved

#### ✅ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Controllers now only handle HTTP concerns
- Services focus on business logic
- Repositories handle only data access
- Processors specialize in Q agent operations

#### ✅ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules depend on abstractions
- Concrete implementations are injected
- Easy to swap implementations for testing

#### ✅ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- New processors can be added without modifying existing code
- New RAG services can be plugged in via interface
- Extensible architecture

#### ✅ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Small, focused interfaces
- Clients depend only on methods they use
- Clear contracts between components

#### ✅ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- All implementations can be substituted for their interfaces
- Consistent behavior across implementations

### Usage Examples

#### Using the Refactored Architecture

```python
# Get services from container
from core.container import container
from services.refactored_request_service import RefactoredRequestService

request_service = container.get(RefactoredRequestService)
request = request_service.create_request('breakdown', 'test.txt')
```

#### Adding New Processors

```python
from services.processors.base_processor import BaseQAgentProcessor

class CustomProcessor(BaseQAgentProcessor):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('custom-agent')
    
    def _create_prompt(self, content, context):
        return f"Custom prompt: {content}"
    
    def _get_fallback_result(self):
        return {"status": "custom_fallback"}
```

#### Testing with Mocks

```python
# Easy to mock interfaces for testing
class MockRAGService(RAGServiceInterface):
    def query(self, action_type, query_text):
        return {"status": "mock", "results": []}

container.register_instance(RAGServiceInterface, MockRAGService())
```

### Migration Path

#### For Existing Controllers
1. Inject services via container instead of direct instantiation
2. Move business logic to service layer
3. Use proper exception handling
4. Return structured responses

#### For Existing Services
1. Implement appropriate interfaces
2. Use dependency injection for dependencies
3. Add proper error handling and logging
4. Split large services into focused components

### Next Steps (Future Phases)

#### Phase 2: Complete Service Refactoring
- Refactor remaining controllers
- Add service decorators (logging, caching, retry)
- Implement command/query pattern

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Add service health checks
- Implement circuit breaker pattern
- Add metrics and monitoring
- Performance optimizations

#### Phase 4: Testing Infrastructure
- Unit test framework with mocks
- Integration test improvements
- Performance test automation
- Contract testing

### Benefits Realized

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
2. **Testability**: Easy to mock dependencies
3. **Extensibility**: New features can be added cleanly
4. **Reliability**: Proper error handling and validation
5. **Performance**: Optimized service lifecycle management

### Running the Refactored Code

```bash
# Test the refactored architecture
python migrate_to_refactored.py

# Run with refactored services
python app.py
```

The refactored architecture provides a solid foundation for professional-grade application development while maintaining backward compatibility with existing functionality.
